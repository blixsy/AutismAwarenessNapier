                <p>Welcome to our project showcase! Here, we're excited to present our collaborative project: a 2D animated video titled <br>
				'Coping with Sensitivity and Perception as an Autistic Person.' Created as part of our courses at  <br>
				Edinburgh Napier University, this animation explores the challenges of sensory overload faced by neurodivergent individuals.<br>
<br>
				Our diverse team of students worked closely with our clients from Edinburgh Napier University's <br>
				research project to develop this engaging narrative. Through innovative storytelling and creative design, <br>
				we aim to raise awareness about autism and provide valuable insights into strategies for managing sensory sensitivities.<br>
<br>
				In addition to the animated video, we've curated this companion website to offer further context and resources related to our project. <br>
				Join us as we take you behind the scenes of the animation's creation on the 'Behind the Scenes' page, from initial concept to final production. <br>
				Explore the impactful research conducted on the 'Resources' page, and delve into the team dynamics and individual contributions <br>
				on the 'Meet the Team' page.<br>

			<h2>Our mission is guided by several core objectives:</h2>

			<h3>Raising Awareness:</h3> <p>We are committed to shining a light on the unique experiences of individuals who think, learn, and experience the world differently. <br> Specifically, we focus on those facing challenges with how they perceive and react to the world around them due to autism. <br>Our goal is to help others understand the diverse ways people's brains work and how we can support each other better.</p>
			<h3>Fostering Understanding:</h3> <p>Our aim is to deepen society's understanding of neurodiversity â€“ the idea that everyone's brain works differently. <br>By fostering empathy, acceptance, and support for individuals across the autism spectrum, <br>we strive to create a world where everyone feels valued and respected for who they are.</p>
			<h3>Providing Valuable Resources:</h3> <p>Through our animated video and website, we provide a variety of resources, information, and tools designed for <br>individuals, families, educators, and professionals within the autism community. <br>Our goal is to empower people with knowledge and support to navigate life's challenges more effectively.</p>
			<h3>Inspiring Positive Change:</h3> <p>We seek to inspire positive change by sharing stories, insights, and experiences that challenge stereotypes and <br>promote greater inclusivity and accessibility for neurodivergent individuals. By highlighting the strengths and contributions of people with autism, <br>we aim to create a more inclusive society where everyone can thrive.</p>
			<h2>We aim to work towards creating a more compassionate, understanding, and inclusive world for all individuals, celebrating the rich diversity within society.</h2>
