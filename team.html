            My name is Chiara Louise Butt. I am the project manager of this project. I am also one of<br> 
			the sound designers specialising in Dialogue Editing. I decided to work on this project since <br>
			it is advertising Autistic Hypersensitivity. This subject is very important to me because I am <br>
			an Autistic person in my 20’s and I got my  official diagnosis back in 2014.

            Hi! My name is Fraser Gallagher (He/Him) and I’m a 3rd year sound design student. <br>
			My main interests in sound design are video games <br>
			but I also enjoy doing work for movies and series too. <br>
			<br> In my free time I enjoy surfing and rock climbing, and with that I like to integrate a lot of nature based influences into my work!

            My name is Brandon Dillon.
			I am a 3D character and asset artist, currently studying at Edinburgh Napier University. I started<br>
			studying Game Design at Fife College, which led my passion for 3D modelling. I studied my HNC<br>
			& HNC in 3D modelling.<br>
			I am now studying my degree in Animation for Games at Edinburgh Napier University. I am<br>
			proficient in the use of 3DS Max, Blender, Substance Painter and Paint.NET.<br>
			My hobbies include playing video games, learning as much as I can about 3D modelling, painting<br>
			figurine miniatures, listening to music to help me focus and relax with my studies and watching scifi films – something that from an early age <br>
			influenced me to work towards finding a job in the animation or games industry. <br>
			I was diagnosed with Autism at a young age, which was part of what drew me with this project to<br>
			help bring more awareness to autism hypersensitive and the coping mechanisms that are available.<br>
			It has been an excellent opportunity to use my skills as a 3D character modeller and animator on<br>
			this project by modelling some of the characters, creating shaders for them, and animating some of<br>
			the scenes.<br>
			I am proud to have worked on this project and to have helped spread more information about neurodiversity.<br>

        I'm a final year DMID student based in Edinburgh, with a strong artistic background and a <br>
		passion for games, 3D modelling and storytelling.<br>
		mainly work in 3D modelling and texturing assets and props, but I also have experience<br>
		in 3D character modelling and 3D animation. I am proficient in Blender, Maya, 3DsMax,<br>
		Substance Painter, Unreal Engine 5 and Adobe Create.<br>
		Currently, I complement my studies with my work as a freelance 3D artist, but I'm looking<br>
		for a full-time opportunity where I can showcase my creative skills.<br>

            My name is Zakarya Hassan. I am a third year DMID student based in Edinburgh, with a strong <br>
			background and a passion for graphic design, motion graphics and animation. <br>
			I mainly work in graphic design and motion graphics, though I have experience in 3D modelling and texturing assets. <br>
			I am proficient at softwares such as Photoshop, Premier Pro and After Effects, as well as having learned 3DS Max and Blender. <br>
			I joined the group as a Lead Animator for this project. I wanted to.help because the project involved themes based on Autistic Hypersensitivity, <br>
			and they required an animator and graphic designer for this. <br>
			By joining the group it meant that this would be a great opportunity to showcase my creative skills, but also to provide a message to both neurotypical and neurodivergent <br>
			audiences about what a sensory overload can feel like for an autistic person. <br>

            Hello! I'm a third-year student studying web design and development at ENU. I have a deep passion for gaming,<br>
			anime, and all things tech-related! My enthusiasm for these interests fuels my creativity, inspiring vibrant <br>
			and dynamic designs. Being part of communities that embrace neurodiversity, I saw an incredible opportunity to <br>
			broaden my understanding and create a website that celebrates inclusivity and accessibility for all communities. <br>
			I'm excited to embark on this journey and create something truly impactful! :)
